# Hi, I'm Betiel Amanuel ðŸ‘‹
I am a self-taught developer with a deep passion for coding and continuous learning. To further enhance my knowledge, I earned certifications in React from Per Scholas and Node.js from Code the Dream. My journey into coding began during my time at UNC Chapel Hill, where I majored in psychology. I was drawn to the creativity and problem-solving aspects of software development, which sparked my interest in building meaningful solutions.

Currently, I work as a behavioral health therapist, helping children with autism develop essential communication and social skills. I love what I do, and Iâ€™m eager to expand my impact by integrating my software development skills into educational tools. My goal is to build learning management systems or improve communication devices to support children with special needs.

I am constantly learning and seeking real-world projects to enhance my expertise. Iâ€™m also eager to gain more experience in agile environments, where I can collaborate with others to create innovative and impactful digital products.
